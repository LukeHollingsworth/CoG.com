  <div id="loreContent">
   <p>New sect came into being after a rift formed in the cult of the true gamers. The trouble centred around the figure of the True gamer. In the cult of old things were done because they were claimed to be his will. He was an infallible deity.</p>
    <p> We rejected the idea of the True gamer and chose to live in a world where our actions are our own. In the fallout of this decision those left in True sect came to us, they feared being left behind, jealous of the new world we had created but unsure of how to enter it themselves. So, we have produced a clear scripture that describes our beliefs so that all may join us in enlightenment.  </p>
