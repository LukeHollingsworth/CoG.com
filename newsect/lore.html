  <h1>New Sect</h1>
  <div id="loreContent">
    <h3>Part 1 - Truth</h3>
<p>New sect begins with a refusal to believe in absolute truth. We reject any idea of objective reality and cast ourselves into uncertainty. But this is not a loss of purpose nor a weakening of our beliefs. It is a starting point which truly reflects our position within the universe. </p>
    <p>To some the obsession with truth becomes all consuming. Their world view is built brick by brick, laying truth upon truth, but there is no solid foundation with which to begin this construction. The result is an illusion of stability. All their truths are predicated on other truths. </p>
    <p></p>If there is but one piece of knowledge that our cult seeks, New sect knows what it is. For only one thing can be known for certain and called true: 
<h2>I exist.</h2>
