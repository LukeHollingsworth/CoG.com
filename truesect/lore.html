      <u><b>Core Tenets of True Sect</b></u><br>
    </h2>
      <b>1. Ludic Sanctity:</b> The act of play and gaming is sacred, connecting us to deeper meanings and truths.<br>
      <b>2. Immutable Spirit:</b> The Spirit of the Game underpins all actions and choices in gaming, and is inviolable.<br>
      <b>3. Teleological Purpose:</b> The universe is endowed with value and purpose, in the form of a mastery of the game.<br>
      <b>4. Immediacy of Perception:</b> Our subjective experiences serve as the primary lens through which we interact with reality. To understand the game, one must immerse oneself in the experience of playing it.<br>
      <b>5. The Duality of Insight:</b> Honor both tradition and innovation. Wisdom can be gleaned from the past as much as from new experiences. Balance is the cornerstone of epistemic respect.<br>
      <b>6. Fair Play and Sportsmanship:</b> Uphold the virtues of fairness, mutual respect, and integrity in all interactions.<br>
      <b>7. Unity in Diversity:</b> Different games, genres, and styles of play are different paths to the same underlying Spirit.<br>
      <b>8. Ritualistic Celebration:</b> Milestones and accomplishments in gaming are to be ritualistically celebrated to honour the Spirit of the Game.<br>
      <b>9. Covenant of Challenges:</b> Difficulties, both in-game and in life, are tests from the Spirit of the Game designed to lead us toward greater mastery.<br>
      <b>10. Reverence for the Meta:</b> Acknowledge that the game exists within a larger 'meta' of human interaction and societal norms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>We hold these rules to be self-evident.</b><br>

      <u><b>History of True Sect</b></u><br>
    </h2>
    In the earliest annals of our shared cult history, there echoed a single, uniting drumbeat: a profound allegiance to an ethos. That ethos, vibrant and alive, was the spirit of gaming. It was the sacred fire that kindled our passion, the very lifeblood of our communal identity. <br>
    <br>
    But as with all profound tenets, the spirit's true nature remained shrouded in the mysteries of interpretation. Some visualised it as a deity incarnate, the One True Gamer (OTG) – a living testament to the pinnacle of gaming excellence. Others perceived it as an abstract pattern, a behaviour to be emulated, an ideal to which all gamers should aspire. Regardless of our individual interpretations, a shared conviction reverberated through our ranks: an unwavering belief in the truth and inherent goodness of this guiding spirit. <br>
    <br>
    However, the unblemished tapestry of the collective began to fray. The cult witnessed duplicitous machinations, by the now-named Grima Wormtongue (ThatGoon), aimed at corrupting the revered position of King. Concurrently, VainGoon, fueled by ambitious fire, laid claims and endeavoured to ascend the throne. His challenges met with failure. Disillusioned, both veered away from the collective, turning their backs on our foundational beliefs. Their distance from the nourishing light of the Game made them cruel and bitter; they attacked the members and beliefs of the remaining members, leading to the final divide between New and True sects. <br>
    <br>
    Emerging from this disillusionment, New sect wove a doctrine that was a stark departure from our shared history. They rejected the very bedrock of our cult – the belief in objective truth and knowledge. Yet, paradoxically, even as they heralded uncertainty, their actions betrayed an implicit faith in the benevolence of the game. <br>
    <br>
    Today, True Sect remains a beacon of dedication. Our beliefs, though nuanced, remain unshaken. The spirit of gaming, the essence of our cult, continues to be our guiding light. While we honour our past and the wisdom it bestowed upon us, we're not averse to change. Our arms are open, eager to embrace innovations, to welcome the new while cherishing the old. In a world of dichotomies, True Sect stands as a testament to the power of belief, unity, and the enduring spirit of the game. <br>
