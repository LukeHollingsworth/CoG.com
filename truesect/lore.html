      <u><b>Core Tenets of Ludism.</b></u><br>
    </h2>
      <b>1. Ludic Sanctity:</b> The act of play and gaming is sacred, connecting us to deeper meanings and truths.<br>
      <b>2. Immutable Spirit:</b> The Spirit of the Game underpins all actions and choices in gaming, and is inviolable.<br>
      <b>3. Teleological Purpose:</b> The universe is endowed with value and purpose, in the form of a mastery of the game.<br>
      <b>4. Phenomenal Primacy:</b> Our subjective experiences are our primary interface with reality. Thus, truth is not only external but also deeply personal and immediate.<br>
      <b>5. Epistemic Harmony:</b> Both tradition and insight are crucial; one provides a foundation, the other spurs evolution. A balance between the two is key to understanding the Spirit.<br>
      <b>6. Narrative Continuity:</b> The stories, myths, and lore of gaming contribute to its sacredness and should be honoured.<br>
      <b>7. Ethical Sportsmanship:</b> Fair play is not just an option but an imperative, crucial for the maintenance of the Spirit. Cheating if not caught was traditionally allowed in the cult, are we theologically rejecting that here.<br>
      <b>8. Unity in Diversity:</b> Different games, genres, and styles of play are different paths to the same underlying Spirit.<br>
      <b>9. Ritualistic Celebration:</b> Milestones and accomplishments in gaming are to be ritualistically celebrated to honour the Spirit of the Game.<br>
      <b>10. Covenant of Challenges:</b> Difficulties, both in-game and in life, are tests from the Spirit of the Game designed to lead us toward greater mastery.
