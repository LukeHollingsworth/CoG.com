      <u><b>Core Tenets of True Sect</b></u><br>
    </h2>
      <b>1. Ludic Sanctity:</b> The act of play and gaming is sacred, connecting us to deeper meanings and truths.<br>
      <b>2. Immutable Spirit:</b> The Spirit of the Game underpins all actions and choices in gaming, and is inviolable.<br>
      <b>3. Teleological Purpose:</b> The universe is endowed with value and purpose, in the form of a mastery of the game.<br>
      <b>4. Immediacy of Perception:</b> Our subjective experiences serve as the primary lens through which we interact with reality. To understand the game, one must immerse oneself in the experience of playing it.<br>
      <b>5. The Duality of Insight:</b> Honor both tradition and innovation. Wisdom can be gleaned from the past as much as from new experiences. Balance is the cornerstone of epistemic respect.<br>
      <b>6. Fair Play and Sportsmanship:</b> Uphold the virtues of fairness, mutual respect, and integrity in all interactions.<br>
      <b>7. Unity in Diversity:</b> Different games, genres, and styles of play are different paths to the same underlying Spirit.<br>
      <b>8. Ritualistic Celebration:</b> Milestones and accomplishments in gaming are to be ritualistically celebrated to honour the Spirit of the Game.<br>
      <b>9. Covenant of Challenges:</b> Difficulties, both in-game and in life, are tests from the Spirit of the Game designed to lead us toward greater mastery.<br>
      <b>10. Reverence for the Meta:</b> Acknowledge that the game exists within a larger 'meta' of human interaction and societal norms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>We hold these rules to be self-evident.</b><br>
